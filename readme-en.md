In summary, the application consists of my result when doing the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/pmfrVwEEjDQgZlItVmjr9c/Challenge%3A-Delta-Code?node-id=0-1&t=bqDD8plVKRwU2Sq4- 0">Delta Code calendar technical test</a>, where you should basically develop this layout provided with fidelity, the main part of the test being the development of the calendar component with the required interactions and respecting the constraint of doing from 0, without the aid of any external lib.
<br/><br/>
As mentioned in the instructions, I was quite tempted to develop an API for this application, but upon reflection I realized that due to the 7 day deadline, both the API and the Interface would be pretty average for lack of time if I tried to develop both, so I decided to focus on all my time and effort on the Front-end (but I will still develop this API in the future 🤩), and delving as much as I can into it within that timeframe, trying to develop an extremely scalable, maintainable code, and mainly, going beyond what was required in the calendar instructions.
<br/><br/>
Also, I believe that my approach of focusing all my time on the Front-end has much more to do with the essence of the test, because after all I am applying for a Front-end position, and the test's main objective, in addition to to evaluate the fidelity of my Interface design, also evaluate the quality of my code and how I solve a specific problem as a Front-end Dev, so nothing better than seeing me suffering trying to develop a calendar component <b>fully functional</b> and <b>from scratch</b> 😂
<br/><br/>
Well, after that more relaxed introduction, in the sections below I go into more detail about each part of the application.
<br/>
I also recommend checking out the <a href="#-tecnologias-utilizados">Technologies</a> section, if you want to know why I chose the technologies used, and the <a href="# %EF%B8%8F-steps">Steps</a> if you want to have an overview of how the project has evolved.

### 📑 Components

#### The application has 10 components, namely:

   - `components/App`: This component is basically where the entire application is located. It reflects a good practice I have of centralizing the entire application in it, and rendering it in `main`, for organization purposes;
   - `components/Header`: This component is the header of the application;
   - `components/NavigationPanel`: This component is the left (desktop) or bottom (mobile) navigation panel;
   - `components/MainContent`: This component is what groups the main information of the application, basically the user data (name, photo...) at the beginning and the calendar components;
   - `components/UserCalendar`: This is the first calendar component, relative to the actual calendar itself. From the received data, it dynamically returns the time jump buttons above the calendar, days of the week, days of the selected month... It is also possible to select the days, months and years of the calendar, and also shows the days that have highlighted events;
   - `components/CalendarSelect`: This component is used within `components/UserCalendar`, and it is responsible for streamlining and standardizing the month and year selection process, in addition to preventing code repetition;
   - `components/UserCalendarEvents`: This is the second calendar component, being responsible for showing the result of user interaction with the `components/UserCalendar` component, or even showing in more detail what is already being shown in `components /UserCalendar`. That is, it is responsible for showing, for example, the legend informing the status of the selected month/year (if it has events or not, and if so, which ones), or the data of the days that contain events, when the user clicks on those days ;

  <br/>

  - `context/UserCalendarContext`: This component is the Context API that wraps the components of `components/UserCalendar` and `components/UserCalendarEvents`, so that both can exchange information more easily and neatly;
   - `styles/GlobalStyles`: This is the component that applies the global styles of the application, it is used in `main`;
   - `styles/theme/default`: This component has to do with the themeProvider feature of Styled Components, where all information related to the theme's color is stored. This is another good practice I always use when using Styled components, for organization and flexibility when dealing with themes or just colors in general.

### 📄 Utils

#### The application has 3 utilities, namely:

   - `utils/getFormattedCurrency`: Responsible for, from the number received, returning it correctly formatted in 'BRL;
   - `utils/calendarHelpers`: Responsible for having several and varied functions/information useful when dealing with the components of `components/UserCalendar` and `components/UserCalendarEvents`, namely:
     - `monthNamesList` and `weekdayNamesList`: These are respectively: a list containing the names of the 12 months of the year, and a list containing the names of the 7 days of the week. When dealing with dates in Javascript, it returns the months and days of the week in the form of numbers, and I use these lists to name these numbers with their respective names in the position of the array.
     - `getYearsRangeList`: This function returns an array of years based on the `year` and `range` information it receives. It is used in `components/UserCalendar` to assemble the selection of years.
     - `getRangeOfDaysInMonth`: This function returns an array of days based on the `year` and `month` information it receives, containing 42 items to fill the 7x6 calendar grid layout, following the pattern of system calendars, showing the last days of the previous month and the first days of the following month;
     - `getCorrectRangeOfDaysInMonth`: There are times when I need an array with only the days of the year and month informed, and for that there is this function. It receives the return from the previous function (that is, an array with 42 items) and filters it, leaving only the days of the month and year informed. An example of using this function is in `components/UserCalendarEvents`, where I depend exclusively on the days of the selected month/year to structure how they will appear in the legend;
    - `getFormattedDate`: Based on the received date, this function can return this date formatted in `JSON` or in `pt-BR`. An example of using this function is in `components/UserCalendarEvents` - when the user clicks on a day on the calendar and the formatted date appears in the title;
     - `getCalendarEventsAlert`: From the received date, this function returns the type of event (incoming, outgoing, or both) of a day and relates it to their respective possible occurrences (if that day has only one event, or more, and if there are more, if they are the same type or not). Simply put, there are 5 possible returns: 1. The day only had one event, and it was of type 'in', 2. The day only had one event, and it was of type 'out', 3. The day had more than one event , and they were all of type 'in', 4. The day had more than one event, and they were all of type 'out', 5. The day had more than one event, and not all were of type 'in' and not all 'output' (ie were mixed);
     - `getUserEventsInSelectedDay`: From the received date (in JSON), this function checks if the user has any event on that date and returns it. An example of using this function is when the user clicks on a day on the calendar - if that day has events, they will be shown on the side, otherwise a message informing that that day has no events;
   - `utils/userMockup`: This component is one of the most important and impactful of the entire application. I based my logic on the user model that this component exports, thus simulating an API, and in that same component, I left an example structure with events spread over the year just to get an idea of how it would be if you were consuming an API with all these data taken from your account, such as the Google Calendar API or the like;
